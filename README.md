# Tmisc

The `Tmisc` package is where I keep miscellaneous functions. Most of them were pulled from my `.Rprofile`, and many were stolen from other packages or random places around the web. I tried to give credit where credit is due in the documentation.

```r
# Install the package
library(devtools)
install_github("stephenturner/Tmisc")

# Load the package (once)
library(Tmisc)
```
