# Tmisc

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/Tmisc)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=Tmisc)

The `Tmisc` package is where I keep miscellaneous functions. Most of them were pulled from my `.Rprofile`, and many were stolen from other packages or random places around the web. I tried to give credit where credit is due in the documentation.

Install from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Tmisc):

```r
install.packages("Tmisc")
```

Install from [GitHub](https://github.com/stephenturner/Tmisc) (potentially unstable):

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stephenturner/Tmisc")
```
